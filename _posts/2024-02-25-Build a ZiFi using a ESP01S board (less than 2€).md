In this post I will create the cheapest DSTIKE deauther to constantly deauthenticate devices in a wifi network or perform other types of wireless attacks.

The ESP01S is a compact WiFi-enabled microcontroller, serves as the cornerstone of our ZiFi EvilTwin  [Link](https://github.com/sankethj/ZiFi). With its capabilities, we can emulate a legitimate WiFi network and intercept data from unsuspecting users who connect to it.

## Prerequisites

ESP01S.

Arduino IDE

## Installation

Once you have the two pieces, connect the ESP01S to the USB adapter (LIKE THIS!):

⚠️Be careful with connecting the esp01s wrong, it has to be like in the picture above, not the other way, you can get a burn if you turn it upside down.

There are 8 pins but each pin is not the same as the other, each one has its function, if you put them upside down, the power remains in the adapter heating the chips and does not pass to the ESP01S ⚠️

Install the drivers for the CH341 chip, utilized with ESP01 USB adapter from [here](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html)

Then, it's time to flash the DSTIKE deauther firmware, so first download it from the [original website.](https://deauther.com/docs/download/)

.BIN --> DSTIKE --> NODECMU

Now let's open Arduino IDE and add an dditional Board URL:

Open preferences from File > Preferences.

In the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field, paste the following link:http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

Once you have all the above, install the drivers:

Navigate to Tools > Board: "Arduino UNO" > Board Manager...

In the Board Manager, search for "esp" and install "ESP8266 by ESP8266 Community".

With these steps, our Arduino IDE is configured to program the ESP-01 board. For this type of board, we can leave other configuration parameters at their default values:

    Flash Mode → "DIO"
    Flash Frequency → "40MHz"
    CPU Frequency → "80MHz"
    Flash Size → "512K (64K SPIFFS)"
    Debug port → "Disabled"
    Debug Level → "None"
    Reset Method → "ck"
    Upload Speed → "115200"
